# flask-learning project includes main thigs which mostly used in back-end
* auth
* migration
* database
* swagger doc
* http requests(get, post and etc.)
* cors (i guess it was tuned)
In fact all of this is must be workable with some templates and normal site, however i do not included it, it is just simple test usage
work with test client from the flask. have a nice day :)
